## Hello from my GitHub Page

This page exists primarily because I wanted an excuse to click buttons, write Markdown, and feel productive.

### Currently:
- Learning: GitHub Pages + Markdown
- Building: tiny experiments that may or may not become real projects
- Drinking: water (occasionally coffee)

### Tiny facts
1. I like checklists.
2. I like shipping small things.
3. I like improving stuff one commit at a time.
